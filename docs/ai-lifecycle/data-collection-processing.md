# Data Collection and Processing

Data collection is a crucial step in the data-driven project lifecycle, involving the **gathering of data and metadata from multiple sources**. The process involves identifying upstream points of attention, such as personally identifiable information, data quality, and ethical considerations. This process relies on the expertise of business and domain experts, who have a deep understanding of the relevant data sources, as well as the implications of using them. Also, Data Scientists and Data Engineers are already enrolled 

Data processing involves the validation and cleaning of data that has been collected. The goal of this step is **to produce a dataset that can be used to build and validate models or algorithms** effectively. Data Scientists and Data Engineers play a critical role in this step, using their strong knowledge to ensure that the data is reliable, accurate, and appropriately prepared for downstream analysis. Through their efforts, they can help to minimize the potential for errors or bias in the resulting dataset.

**Documenting the data collection and processing steps is essential** to ensure consistency and reproducibility in the project. It enables all stakeholders and representative actors to retrace the process of creating the dataset from the raw data sources, ensuring that any potential errors or issues are identified and addressed appropriately. Additionally, documentation enables the effective sharing of data and results across the team, promoting collaboration and facilitating the successful completion of the project.

## Representative Actors

#### Business and domain experts

The contribution of business and domain experts is indispensable in the data collection process. These experts possess the requisite knowledge to determine the optimal time and location for data collection. They are skilled at identifying the appropriate data sources, such as internal data, open datasets, or generated datasets, and comprehending the associated implications of each. Moreover, they possess the expertise to determine which information should be utilized in the system to produce the most relevant and valuable answers. Their deep understanding of the business use case, which the system will serve, is invaluable in creating effective models. This knowledge is vital in ensuring that the models developed are tailored to the specific business requirements, resulting in solutions that accurately reflect the real-world situations they are intended to address.

#### Data Scientists and Data Engineers

Data Scientists and Data Engineers are crucial to the success of any data-driven project. Their first responsibility is to identify relevant data sources and extract the necessary data while complying to security protocols. They collaborate closely with business and domain experts to ensure that the extracted data is relevant enough to the use case. Additionally, they utilize their expertise to apply transformation and computation techniques to the data, resulting in valuable datasets that can be used to build effective models.

Moreover, they are essential team members from the outset of any project, contributing their unique skills and knowledge to ensure its success. They can identify potential risks associated to the dataset using data analysis techniques and visualizations. By leveraging their expertise in this area, they can detect and mitigate any potential risks before they become major issues, ensuring that the project remains on track and achieves its objectives.

#### Regulatories experts

Regulatories experts experts possess an in-depth understanding of the relevant laws and regulations, and they are well-versed in the potential implications of noncompliance. Their expertise allows them to identify potential issues when using sensitive variables, thereby minimizing the risk of violations. Additionally, they can assist in identifying the risks associated with using variables that might not comply with company policies. Their input is crucial in ensuring that the company's data management practices and AI models are in full compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
