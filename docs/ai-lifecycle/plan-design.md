# Plan & Design



## Activities



## Representative Actors

This section presents a list of actors that can be consulted during the AI system's Plan & Design phase. Not all of the listed actors may necessarily be involved in this phase, but it is mainly intended to distinguish the different roles of each one.

#### Business and domain experts

Business and domain experts play a crucial role in the development of AI systems. Their deep understanding of the intended purpose of the system, regardless of whether they represent end users or not, is instrumental in determining the essential characteristics that the future system must possess. By leveraging their expertise and vision, these experts help to ensure that the AI system aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the organization or industry.

#### End users

End users can provide valuable insights during the design phase of an AI system.

For internal use (teams within the organization), end users may be represented by teams within a business unit that will utilize or consume the system. By soliciting their input, the development team can gain a better understanding of their needs and requirements, which is essential for determining the feasibility and designing the future system.

In external situations (customers, public leads on website), end users are more likely to provide informal feedback through surveys, customer knowledge, or discussions, rather than taking part directly in the design of the system. Overall, their feedback is essential to ensuring that the AI system meets their needs and expectations.

#### Governance and compliance experts

Governance and compliance experts also have their part in the design of AI systems. They have strong understanding in the laws, regulations, and policies that govern the use of AI in various industries and contexts. Their expertise enables them to identify potential caveats and issues during the design phase, especially about the system's use and how it will be built. By leveraging their knowledge and experience, these experts can help ensure that the AI system is compliant with applicable regulations and that it adheres to ethical and governance standards.

#### AI Designers

AI Designers, typically comprising Data Scientists, play a crucial role in the conception, development, and assessment of AI systems. They have the technical expertise required to design and develop AI algorithms that can effectively address the challenges and requirements of the intended application. By leveraging their knowledge of machine learning techniques and programming languages, they can create models that accurately and efficiently process large volumes of data. Their involvement throughout the entire lifecycle of the system helps to ensure that it meets the desired specifications and achieves the intended outcomes.

#### Developers and integrators

If the system is expected to be deployed as a service, whether for internal or public use, developers and integrators can also provide useful insights. They have extensive knowledge of the organization's IT infrastructure, which is essential for ensuring the successful integration of the AI system into the existing architecture. Their technical expertise will allow them to apprehend the technical needs for deployment, such as scalability, security, compatibility as well as availability with other systems.
