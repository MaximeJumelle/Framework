# The Lifecycle

An AI System is not a service or a product that can be created as a single process. It evolves over time and many different actors along its lifetime.

A System AIâ€™s state depends on its lifecycle : we propose the **AI Lifecycle** which is composed of 6 stages. Each **stage** indicates an actual state of the AI System.

## Plan & Design

This is the first step when creating AI System. Before jumping right into finding and collecting data, it is first mandatory to understand which business objectives and requirements are assigned. This first part involve a lot of actors that documents the future AI System, provide context and point out underlying assumptions.

## Data Collection and Processing

Data collection is the process to gather data and metadata from multiple sources while identifying upstream points of attention such as personally identifiable informations, data quality or

Data Processing is the process to validate and clean data once it has been collected. Usually, the Data Processing step is expected to produce a dataset that can be used to build and validate models or algorithms.

All of this step has to be documented to consistently retrace the process of creating the dataset from the raw data sources.

## Model Building

Model Building is the process to create, select and train models or algorithms based on the datasets constructed from the previous stage.
