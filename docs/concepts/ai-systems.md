# AI Systems

An **AI System**, or more generally a **System**, is a combination of a **Dataset**, a **Model** and a **Service**.

A system can be referred as a business use case it is trying to solve.

- In a financial context, a KYC software can be considered as a system.
- In the insurance industry, you can consider a pricing model for life-insurance policies as a system.
- In an marketing context, a software that identify customers that are willing to present an interest for a product or a service, is also a system.

Because these systems are complex, they can not be only referred as an algorithm : they also **consume data for both training and inference**.
