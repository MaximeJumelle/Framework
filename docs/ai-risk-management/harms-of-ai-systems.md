# Harms of AI Systems

The negative impacts of AI systems are wide-ranging and the potential harms they may cause are not limited to individuals. Indeed, in the past few years, many examples have shown that AI system decisions can adversely affect not only individuals, but also communities, organizations, and even entire ecosystems in the worst cases.

### Individuals

The most immediate negative impact of AI systems could be on individuals, affecting their physical integrity (such as in the case of autonomous vehicles) or civil liberties and rights. For example, if an AI system's outputs are used to make decisions on life insurance policies or medical inquiry forms, it might take into account characteristics that could unfairly prevent the person from accessing their rights.

### Communities

Another negative impact of AI systems can be identified on communities, as AI systems can cause harm such as discrimination.

### Organization

The organization itself that proposes the AI system can also be impacted by negative outcomes. Firstly, the AI system can harm its business operations when used internally, such as providing bad marketing insights or producing false positives. Secondly, when the AI system is publicly available to end-users, it can degrade the organization's reputation in case of bad publicity. Finally, the AI system can also result in financial loss to the company and pose security issues.

### Environment

On a larger scale, AI systems can harm entire ecosystems. For example, in the context of insurance, using an AI system that does not provide enough fund provisioning to withstand a financial shock could heavily weaken an insurance company, which could no longer fulfill its obligations to its customers. This could trigger a chain reaction that affects other insurance companies as well.
