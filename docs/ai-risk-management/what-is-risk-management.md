# What is Risk Management ?

Let us be honest : our role is not to redefine what exactly is Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), as many companies already include various frameworks inside their organization. However, our mission is to provide helpful methods to introduce AI into Risk Management practices already in place.

> Risk management refers to coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.

## Definition of Risk

**The risk is the effect of uncertainty on the achievement of objectives.**

> Under this definition, the achievement of objectives can be positive, negative or neutral. Even though risk management is usually motivated to identify risks of negative impacts, it might be also relevant to identify opportunities that could maximize positive impacts.

As a matter of fact, a risk is a combination of multiple components.

- A scenario of a possible event.
- A probability of occurrence of this scenario.
- The consequences of this scenario.
